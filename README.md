# Best ML Algorithm Finder
This is a project I created within a small timeframe (2 to 3 hrs) during the Math Coding &amp; AI summer camp at NIT Calicut. This takes any preprocessed dataset and trains it with different ML algorithm and returns the algorithm with the highest accuracy. The algorithms that are used to train: Logistic Regression, Support vector machine, Categorical NB, Decision Tree.
